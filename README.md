　　This is a project homework of the course DataMining in this term. I programed the C4.5 algorithm in matlab to finish the task to classify the Wine DataSet which was downloaded from UCI maching learning reposotory(http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine). Following are some statements.\\
  　First, wine.m is the final executable program;\\
    Second, I have already downloaded the wine DataSet and saved in the file "WineData.text"; In order to execute the program without error, you should make sure that wine.m and WineData.text are in the same repository.
